The aim of this application is to calculate the polynomials for different kinds of operations including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integration and differentiation. 
For this project, hash maps were used as the main data structure to store the coefficients and the degrees of the polynomials. Furthermore, for splitting in parts the coefficients and polynomials RegEx was used.
